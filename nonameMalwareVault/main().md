* some long array of bytes at the beginning. probably something encrypted
* 0x00405272 - 0x004052cc loading strings1
* 0x004052d4 - 0x00405360 write lauch string to .bss
/var/run/xinetd.lockd [start at 0x00606460]
* access(4, /var/run/xinetd.lockd)
* fcn.0040302f - shellcode executor function, returns 0 if there is read access to /var/rin/xinetf.lockd, else 1
* generates random value at address 0x004053e3 and further. after that performs some crypto operations. I commented them, but i will have to implement them in c pseudocode (or use some disassembler, but i don't like free ones, so meh...) to fully understand their meaning 
* crypto stuff at addresses: 0x004053fd - 0x00405416

[[big code samples#asm crypto in main]]

* Note: I had not been paying enough attention when performing decompilation by hands and code above gives false results. Maybe i will find an error later. For now i just copied all crypto instructions to file and compiled it with nasm, and i got such results:
*  [[General notes#results table for cryptostuff at 0x004053f4]]
*  after that curious algo it copies some *random* (actually, one element from [0-9] or [0;-9]) array element (of size 8 bytes) at base - 0xb0 + array_element_number.
*  depending on above results, min offset is 0 and max offset is 9x8 = 0x48 or 72

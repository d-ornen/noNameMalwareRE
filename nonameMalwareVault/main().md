* some long array of bytes at the beginning. probably something encrypted
* 0x00405272 - 0x004052cc loading strings1
* 0x004052d4 - 0x00405360 write lauch string to .bss
/var/run/xinetd.lockd [start at 0x00606460]
* access(4, /var/run/xinetd.lockd)
* fcn.0040302f - shellcode executor function, returns 0 if there is read access to /var/rin/xinetf.lockd, else 1
* generates random value at address 0x004053e3 and further. after that performs some crypto operations. I commented them, but i will have to implement them in c pseudocode (or use some disassembler, but i don't like free ones, so meh...) to fully understand their meaning 
* crypto stuff at addresses: 0x004053fd - 0x00405416
